## My Dino -- Winnie Zong

This is 3D version of the running dinosaur game we play when Chrome has no internet connection.

## How to play

* Mouse Click to start.
* Mouse Click to jump.
* Mouse Click to restart.
* Avoid the cactus.
* It is getting faster!
* The background music works in Safari but not in Chrome on my computer.
* But sometimes Safari had unexpected bugs when running my other repl.it files so I am not super confident with it.
* Please try running the game on both browsers if possible.
* Using a Mac computer is ideal.

## To improve

* Add sound effect.
* The background music sometimes work and sometimes not in repl.it in Chrome.
* The background music sometimes is not working in Chrome on my computer.
* The game has different speed on Windows and Mac computers.
* There are other weird bugs when playing in Safari.
